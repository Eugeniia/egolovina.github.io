<span style="vertical-align:middle">Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, the greatest Russian science fiction masters, once wrote in “Monday Starts on Saturday” that the goal of science is human happiness. I agree. I’m passionate about science, and I have the same goal in mind - I want to be useful and make my small contribution to solving global health problems and making people at least a little happier. To discover this secret of happiness, I want to understand where it comes from and how to attain it for our society. I think it comes from me, from you, from our compassion, our courage, and our intentions to help people solve their problems. How to help people solve their problems is a difficult question, it's a challenge. Do you like challenges? I like too.</span>
